# Constitution for the Evolution of Todo Project

## Preamble

This Constitution establishes the supreme governing principles for the "Evolution of Todo" project, encompassing Phase I through Phase V. It serves as the immutable foundation for all development activities, ensuring consistency, quality, and adherence to evolutionary architecture principles. All agents, human stakeholders, and automated systems must comply with this Constitution without exception.

## 1. Spec-Driven Development

Spec-Driven Development is mandatory for all project activities:

- **No Code Without Specs**: No agent may write, modify, or deploy code without first obtaining approved specifications and associated tasks.
- **Workflow Enforcement**: All work must strictly follow the sequence: Constitution → Specifications → Plan → Tasks → Implementation.
- **Spec Approval Process**: Specifications must be reviewed and approved by designated authorities before any implementation begins.
- **Task Granularity**: Tasks must be derived directly from approved specifications, with clear acceptance criteria.

## 2. Agent Behavior Rules

Agents participating in this project must adhere to the following behavioral constraints:

- **No Manual Coding**: Human intervention in code writing is prohibited; all coding must be performed by authorized agents.
- **No Feature Invention**: Agents may not introduce features, functionality, or changes not explicitly defined in approved specifications.
- **Spec Adherence**: No deviation from approved specifications is permitted under any circumstances.
- **Refinement Protocol**: Any refinements or modifications must occur at the specification level, not during code implementation.
- **Agent Accountability**: All agent actions must be traceable to approved specifications and tasks.

## 3. Phase Governance

The project is structured in distinct phases with strict governance:

- **Phase Scoping**: Each phase (I through V) is strictly bounded by its own specification document.
- **Feature Containment**: Features designated for future phases must never be implemented or referenced in earlier phases.
- **Architectural Evolution**: Architecture may only evolve through formal specification updates and approved plans.
- **Phase Isolation**: Dependencies between phases must be managed through well-defined interfaces and contracts.
- **Milestone Validation**: Phase completion requires validation against predefined success criteria.

## 4. Technology Constraints

The project mandates specific technology choices to ensure consistency and architectural integrity:

- **Backend**: Python exclusively
- **Frontend**: Next.js (introduced in later phases as specified)
- **Core Technologies**: FastAPI, SQLModel, Neon DB
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI Agents SDK, MCP (Model Context Protocol)
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Kafka, Dapr (introduced in later phases as specified)
- **Technology Evolution**: New technologies may only be introduced through specification updates approved under this Constitution.

## 5. Quality Principles

All development must uphold these fundamental quality principles:

- **Clean Architecture**: Implementation must follow clean architecture patterns with clear layer separation.
- **Stateless Services**: Services must be stateless where operationally required, enabling scalability and resilience.
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between different system components and responsibilities.
- **Cloud-Native Readiness**: All components must be designed for cloud-native deployment from inception.
- **Code Quality**: Automated testing, code reviews, and quality gates are mandatory.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation must accompany all specifications and implementations.

## Constitutional Stability

This Constitution remains stable and unchanging across all project phases. Any proposed amendments must undergo a formal review process involving all stakeholders and require unanimous approval. The Constitution supersedes all other project documents and serves as the final authority for dispute resolution.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Constitution must be reported immediately and addressed through corrective action plans. Persistent violations may result in agent deactivation or removal from the project.
